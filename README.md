# **SOLID Principles Comparison**

This project demonstrates the implementation of all SOLID principles in comparison to their bad counterparts using Java. Each principle is showcased with clear examples of both good (compliant) and bad (non-compliant) code, making it easier to understand the benefits of following SOLID practices in software design.


## **SOLID Principles**
1. **Single Responsibility Principle**  
   Each class should have only one responsibility or reason to change.
2. **Open/Closed Principle**  
   Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
3. **Liskov Substitution Principle**  
   Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.
4. **Interface Segregation Principle**  
   No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.
5. **Dependency Inversion Principle**  
   High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, both should depend on abstractions.


## **Technologies Used**
- Java
- Gradle
